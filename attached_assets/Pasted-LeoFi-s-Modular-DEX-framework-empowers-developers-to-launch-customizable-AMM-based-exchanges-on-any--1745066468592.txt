3. Product Overview
3.1 Architecture Overview
LeoFi‚Äôs architecture comprises four core layers:

Factory Contract: Deploys new Pool instances on demand 
Uniswap Docs | Uniswap
uniswapv3book.com
.

Router Contract: Executes swaps, optimizes multi‚Äëhop routes, and interacts with Factory and Pools 
Chainlink: The backbone of blockchain.
uniswapv3book.com
.

Pool Contracts: Implement the AMM curves (e.g., 
ùë•
‚ãÖ
ùë¶
=
ùëò
x‚ãÖy=k or concentrated liquidity) for token pairs 
Chainlink: The backbone of blockchain.
Uniswap Interface
.

ModuleRegistry: Manages auxiliary modules (fee strategies, oracles, limit‚Äëorder approximations) that can be dynamically attached to Pools 
LinkedIn
.

3.2 Core Components
Factory Contract: Mirrors Uniswap¬†V2‚Äôs Factory, centralizing Pool creation logic and maintaining a registry of deployed Pools 
Uniswap Docs | Uniswap
.

Router Contract: Facilitates seamless trades by computing optimal paths through multiple Pools, enabling direct and multi‚Äëhop swaps 
uniswapv3book.com
.

Pool Contracts: Support both constant product and concentrated liquidity mechanisms, offering LPs greater flexibility and fee tier granularity 
Uniswap Interface
Uniswap Docs | Uniswap
.

ModuleRegistry: Acts as a permissioned directory for approved modules, ensuring Pools can safely integrate new behaviors without redeploying core logic
